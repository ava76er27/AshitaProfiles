# AshitaProfiles Thanks to other coder's for let me see their work. Haven't program in years
After looking at several other coder's I wrote a few as I need to use Ashitacast gearswap.
If your on Retail Server Please Read Ashitacast Doc's because there is a command to search all
your Inventory which can get you Banned!!! I don't use it in my code.

SMN PUP SCH Profiles...
Summoner was my starting XML with thanks to all the Other Coder's help. This was a mix of 2 other people xml.
If you don't have my gear it's ok.

Prep set which is my Refresh gear. 
PrePact set with avatar favor lower's my Blood Pact time. Am at 20 seconds.
avMaB and avMaBMerit I use my Pet Magic Attack Bonus gear with Magic Attack Bonus Staff.
avAtk set is Pet Attack gear with a different staff not to be confused with a Magic Attack Bonus Staff.
This work for me and am not you and if you have opinion your absolutely right.

I Added Siphon Routine that picks the Right Day for max Siphon. How to setup is in XML file.
					Ashita looks in the folder Scripts under Ashita Folder for 
					the folder siphon for files called
					
					dark.txt earth.txt fire.txt ice.txt light.txt thunder.txt 
					water.txt wind.txt. 
					
  Example wind.txt in ashita - scripts - siphon folder:
					
					/ma "Air Spirit" <me>
					/wait 6
					/ja "Elemental Siphon" <me>
					/wait 2
					/pet "Release" <me>

I've Coded more and am going change this XML more since I learned alot more about Ashitacast.
Alot of my XML use /exec command and the script folder with txt's files to use. /exec files
are the same as using In-Game Macro without the limit of six spaces.
